<h1 class="title">Should you be using PHP's PDO extension for database access?</h1>
<div>
	<p>
		This is a simple tutorial that will cover some information about PDO (PHP Data Object), installation of the PDO MySQL extension on <b>UNIX</b> systems,
		connecting to a MySQL database with PDO features, using queries and prepared statements to add information to database, fetching results from the database, and a final summary of all the steps.
	</p>
</div>

<h2>Well what's PDO exactly?</h2>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>PDO</strong> stands for PHP Data Objects and it is a PHP extension that provides a simpler and consistent interface for accessing databases. PDO can access 12 different databases which include: 

		<br><br>

		<table class="table1">
			<tr><td>Curbid<td>MS SQL Server<td>Firebird				
			<tr><td>IBM<td>Informix<td>MySQL
			<tr><td>Oracle<td>PostgreSQL<td>SQLite
			<tr><td>4D<td>ODBC<td>DB2
		</table>

		<br>

		<li>It is one of three available API's (application programming interface) for connecting to a MySQL database, the other two being MySQL and MySQLi (the improved extension of MySQL).
			<ul>
				<li><b>MySQL</b> is the original extension to access the MySQL database and is supported in older versions of MySQL (4.1.3 and older). <strong>It has been deprecated and PDO or MySQLi (mentioned below) is recommended</strong>.

				<li><b>MySQLi</b> is the improved extension and takes advantage of new features of MySQL in version 4.1.3 or newer. Some benefits over MySQL is that it is that it has an object-oriented interface, supports multiple statements and prepared statements. 
			</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h2>The advantages of PDO</h2>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>One advantage is better security. PDO uses prepared statements (paramaterized queries) that 
			<strong>can protect against SQL injections</strong> (it is a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement where it can compromise the security of the web application).

		<li>Another advantage is that there is input validation such that it checks for and accepts 
			expected input data type and rejects non-acceptable input data types.

		<li>When using a PDO API, a few changes in the PHP code can allow you to connect to other database
		 	servers.
	</ul>
</div>

<h2>The disadvantages of PDO</h2>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Compared to MySQLi extension, PDO is more complex for newcomers to understand. MySQLi offers a procedural API and is an easier transition over from MySQL.
	</ul>
