<h1 class="title">Should you be using PHP's PDO extension for database access?</h1>
<p>
	This is a simple tutorial that will cover some information about PDO, installation on <b>UNIX</b> systems,
	connecting to a MySQL database with PDO, using queries and prepared statements, fetching results,
	and a final summary.
</p>

<h2>Well what's PDO exactly?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>PDO</strong> stands for PHP Data Objects and it is a PHP extension that provides a simpler and consistent interface for accessing databases. PDO can access 12 different databases which include: 
		<ul>
			<li>Curbid 
			<li>MS SQL Server
			<li>Firebird
			<li>IBM
			<li>Informix
			<li>MySQL (main focus of tutorial)
			<li>Oracle
			<li>PostgreSQL
			<li>SQLite
			<li>4D
			<li>ODBC
			<li>DB2
		</ul>
	<li>It is one of three available API's (application programming interface) for connecting to a MySQL database, the other two being MySQL and MySQLi (the improved extension of MySQL).
		<ul>
			<li><b>MySQL</b> is the original extension to access the MySQL database and is supported in older versions of MySQL (4.1.3 and older). <strong>It has been deprecated and PDO or MySQLi (mentioned below) is recommended</strong>.

			<li><b>MySQLi</b> is the improved extension and takes advantage of new features of MySQL in version 4.1.3 or newer. Some benefits over MySQL is that it is that it has an object-oriented interface, supports multiple statements and prepared statements. 
		</ul>
</ul>

<h2>The advantages of PDO</h2>
<ul>
	<li>One advantage is better security. PDO uses prepared statements (paramaterized queries) that 
		<strong>can protect against SQL injections</strong> (it is a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement where it can compromise the security of the web application).

	<li>Another advantage is that there is input validation such that it checks for and accepts 
		expected input data type and rejects non-acceptable input data types.

	<li>When using a PDO API, a few changes in the PHP code can allow you to connect to other database
	 	servers.
</ul>

<h2>The disadvantages of PDO</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compared to MySQLi extension, PDO is more complex for newcomers to understand. MySQLi offers a
		procedural API and is an easier transition over from MySQL.
</ul>
