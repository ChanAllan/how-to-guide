<h1 class="title">Summary of what was covered</h1>
<div>
	<p>
		In this tutorial you learned about PDO (PHP Data Object), how to install PDO on your Unix system, how to use PDO to access a MySQL database, how to use PDO for INSERT queries, how to use PDO for fetching data from a database. Here's the full PHP code of what was covered in this tutorial:

	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
		In the full PHP code above, you may have noticed an extra line of code: <mark><em>$dbh = null</em></mark>. Setting $dbh to null is how you can close the connection to the database.

		I hope you have found this tutorial helpful. This is the end of the tutorial and if you want to learn more about PDO's, you can refer to the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php">official PHP documentation on PDO</a>. This is just the surface of what the PDO extension can do. There are many more things to learn such as improving error and exception handling for security reasons, improving efficiency in processing and retrieving data from databases with the PDO and PDOStatement class.
